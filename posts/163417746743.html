<blockquote><p>Therefore, [Bill] Gates is now meeting with people like Mike Ovitz and 
Barry Diller to discuss better ways of delivering their products into 
people’s homes. “I actually requested a meeting with him,” Ovitz told me
 last October. “I flew up to Seattle and we had dinner together and 
spent three or four hours just talking about the future.”<br/><br/>“Could you say specifically what you talked about?”<br/><br/>“It was just very deep stuff about the future.”<br/><br/>“Well, for example, did you talk about information-highway software?”<br/><br/>“It goes much deeper than that.”</p></blockquote>
