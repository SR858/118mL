<p>do I like opera<br/>
no that isn’t opera <br/>
nor do I like it</p>

<p>what do I even like</p>

<p><br/>
purity. the baroque styles, having been already tarnished by centuries of increasing filth gathering on the harmonies of God, but not yet touched by typhoons of filthy residue and grimy guano still yet to come. it’s rudimentary, like the flavors of foods that appeal to menchi (except for fish, which is also ‘pure’, esp. for a cute lil animal who is prone to like only very salty and sweet only, like humans have certain styles of human food like fried bbq and fudge cake or xtreem cheez bitez splosion in your mouth!)</p>

<p>purity because sexuality somehow? no, of course not. nobody even suggested that you pervert ah ha hah</p>



<p>see how pseudo intele lectual I can be when I got some college like everybody else did but better. I might be watching too much crap UK tv, where david mitchell is the closest thing to a well-read/bred oxtbridge future master of industry and Up the Honors (the cheeky devil, him! oooh!). Radio at least has the weird Tory robot who named his kids Aelfred I or Brexit or some shit and is charming to the max LIKE LAMES BOND</p>

<p>nah it just happens I get to have circuses by coincidence. just the foreign entertainment catering me, a fuckup in terms of a comedy industrial complex as we know it that eats its tail like it should unless I give up and run to London like Lindsay Lohan and other weak minds who idealize a cultural identity (tourism, it’s called) and encourage each other to believe life is best in their part of the world, like the veggie spiralizing nitwits at the west oak coffee &lsquo;bar’ getting their art for the evening by being by some drums and goopy portraits in their samey “art history regurgitated” design style with that Texas (Monthly) flair uniquely our own.</p>

<p>humbug</p>
