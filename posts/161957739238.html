<p>I have gotten spectacular news from my tweetsuite. The premiership​ of Zuid-Afrikjie is vacant. (It’s not a secret. I read it in my timeline and I have 900,000 followers. I’m certain there is no embargo in effect.) I waited half an hour before volunteering my fa***-ass bowler-headed trampy ol’ dinner roll dancin’ self for the official statehead muster roll. Arriving at 9am, I was the first applicant for premiership to arrive, with the others vying for the cabinet positions like barista and certified Valspar® team member. Once the paperwork was signed, I unfolded my bicycle and patrolled the kingdom I am to govern, a job at which my brothers before me were nearly competent. <i>“All Hear This: Lord Mayor of Capetoon say onto the people, Hallo my lovely populace.”</i></p><p>It was as if they didn’t know who I am. I was disparaged like a mere mutt in the allyway with the hashers and dronkards. Speedily I got on discord chat with the current CFO of ADT Home Security, a position similar to the Archbishop of Canterbury under my native UK-GB monarchy’s ritual sex-magick, who assures me of my legitimacy in the honble service in Capetoon City, taxiing Mandèla’s nuclear football hither and zither for many terms until my position is made redundant.</p>
