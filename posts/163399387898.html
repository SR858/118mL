<p>it is bad that someday we will always be surrounded in procedurally 
composed music based on our personal tastes, mixed in rhythm to our 
energy level and biorhythms?<br/><br/>or is it? no it is not, maybe.<br/><br/>but
 music would be less human? but so then humans feel more like music, and I&rsquo;m sure the first caveman band would have preferred it, had it been 
feasible from day one.<br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;yes, you will start to notice in 
years to come, humans will be less a part of the visual and performing 
arts. things will gradually be less decorative and more obtuse, 
imposing, very metallic structures that resonate with eerie clicks 
sounding up from the brushed aluminum manhole covers&rdquo;<br/></p>
