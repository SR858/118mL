<h2>I am very vain</h2>
<p>I sometimes get out of bed just to look at myself in the mirror.</p>

<p>However, I just got back from the gas station at 11am on a Saturday and was upset to see beautiful boys wearing suits when <b>I</b> am supposed to be the most beautiful boy in the gas station. I never go to the gas station at 11am on a Saturday.</p>

<p>I swiftly returned home for some emergency blogging and I feel a tiny bit better.</p>
